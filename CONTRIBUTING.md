# How to contribute?
## Make pull request
- Make issue
- Fork project, and clone your local
- Make branch which named like feature/{...} or fix/{...}
- Commit your code and make pull request
  - Before commit, run `npm test` to check code coverage
## Commit convention
- [Read this](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

## Note
- You must write test code
- In my opinion, it is a small code, so code coverage should be 100%. But this is tunable. Tell your opinion.
- Don't modify config files like `jest.config, tsconfig.json, main.yml, .gitignore` .. etc

Thank you for your contribution
